# Data Orchestration Strategy

## Overview
Evolution from one-off data ingestion scripts to a comprehensive, scalable data platform that can support multiple dashboard portfolio pieces with advanced orchestration capabilities.

## Current State - FULLY IMPLEMENTED ✅
- Individual ingestion components (GTFS, PTV, Data.vic)
- Automated execution via `data_ingestion_01.py` with full orchestration
- Advanced error handling, logging, and notifications
- Parquet-based storage in /data/curated/
- **NEW**: Timeout enforcement, quota management, parallel execution, and performance monitoring

## Target Architecture - ACHIEVED ✅
Two-tier orchestration system with advanced features:
1. **One-off Orchestration** - Discovery, backfills, ad-hoc analysis
2. **Temporal Orchestration** - Scheduled, recurring data updates
3. **NEW**: Parallel execution, timeout management, performance monitoring, and notifications

## Implementation Phases
