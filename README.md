# Hi there, welcome to my Data Analysis Portfolio!

Welcome to my Data Portfolio! This repository showcases various projects that highlight my skills in data collection, analysis, and visualisation. I dive deep into datasets to uncover patterns and insights, presenting the findings through clear, actionable visuals.


## Projects in This Repository

1. **IBM Project** – A project that explores a dataset from IBM, where I used Python to analyse and visualise complex data, uncovering key insights.
2. **Superstore Case Study** – A thorough exploration of sales data to identify trends, performance gaps, and optimisation opportunities.
3. **Train Case Study** – Analysing train station data, focusing on performance metrics and optimising schedules based on patterns.
4. **Plant Co.** – A sales performance dashboard which helps managers quickly assess how well the company is performing.

## Why Data?

Data is everywhere. Whether it's business, technology, or healthcare, data powers our decisions. In this portfolio, you’ll see how I take raw numbers and turn them into meaningful stories with the help of Python, SQL, and various data visualisation tools.


## Key Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data processing and visualisation.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: To create clean, readable, and interactive analyses.
- **SQL**: For querying and handling large datasets.
- **Google Looker Studio**: For creating interactive data visualisations in the IBM project.
- **Power BI**: For building dashboards and insightful visualisations.


## What’s Next?

I’m constantly working on new projects and exploring additional datasets. Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to develop my data skills.
