### ⚡ Key Technologies Used:

- **Python** 🐍: For data processing and visualisation.
- **Jupyter Notebooks** 📓: To create clean, readable, and interactive analyses.
- **SQL** 🔎: For querying and handling large datasets.
- **Google Looker Studio** 📊: For creating interactive data visualisations in the IBM project.
- **Power BI** 📉: For building dashboards and insightful visualisations.

### 📈 What’s Next?

I’m constantly working on new projects and exploring additional datasets. Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to push my data skills to the next level!
